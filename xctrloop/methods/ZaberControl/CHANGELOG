1.1.0 (2018/01)
---------------
* Fixed incorrect velocity unit conversions.
* Fixed compatibility with MATLAB R2016a and R2017a.
* Changed behavior for unrecognized devices. Devices not listed in 
  DeviceDatabase.mat will now function instead of throwing an error, but 
  unit conversions will be incorrect and a generic device name will 
  be assigned.
* Changed the behavior of the Python script that updates the device 
  database. The default behavior is now to update both the device table 
  and the enumerations, but not to download the source database if it
  is already present. To force a fresh download, either use the --download
  command-line option or delete any existing sqlite3 file in the directory.

1.0.0 (2016/11)
---------------
* Initial implementation. First public release.
